       <p>This is an old blog post. I originally wrote it for the blog at my startup,
       (omniref.com), which has long since shut down. I ported some of the posts here,
       because they were popular, and some people asked me to resurrect them. Remember,
       these are old, things might have changed, blah blah blah...</p>
