Hi. I'm Tim. I'm on sabbatical in Kyoto, where I'm studying Japanese (because life
isn't hard enough, apparently), and decompressing from an eventful near-decade in San
Francisco.

I'm a programmer, scientist and nerd. I was once a computational biologist, but I 
left behind research to become one of the first engineers at this goofy live video site 
where some dude strapped a camera to his head and broadcast his life. It was an inexplicably 
bad career decision. But as further proof that even astronomically unlikely events will 
happen given enough time, that startup eventually became [Twitch](https://twitch.tv). 
I can't explain it either.

Later, I was an early engineer at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com), where I did what would
eventually be called "data science", but at the time was just "science". After that, 
I created a few things of my own (Omniref.com, Vayable.com), because life is too short
not to take a few chances. Those didn't really work out, but not for lack of trying. 

I enjoy cooking, coffee and a good onsen. I don't think I'll ever like natto.
