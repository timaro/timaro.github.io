Hi. I'm Tim. I'm a scientist and engineer at [Schr&ouml;dinger](https://www.schrodinger.com/) 
in New York City, where I'm working on problems at the intersection of AI and pharmaceutical 
development. 

I've had an odd career trajectory. I started as a programmer, went to graduate school
in biochemistry and earned a degree in computational biology, but I eventually 
left research behind to become one of the first engineers at this goofy live video site, 
where some dude strapped a camera to his head and broadcast his life. It was an inexplicably 
bad career decision. But as further proof that even astronomically unlikely events will 
occur given sufficient outlook, that startup eventually became [Twitch](https://twitch.tv). 
I can't explain it either.

Later, I was an early engineer at [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com), where I did what would
eventually be called "data science", but at the time was just "science". After that, 
I created a few things of my own (Omniref.com, Vayable.com), because life is too short
not to take a few chances. Those didn't really work out, but not for lack of trying. 

I enjoy cooking, coffee, and a good onsen (温泉、look it up). You may contact me at tim@500errors.com
