# Summary

Hi, I'm Tim. I'm a full-stack engineer, but I have a doctorate in computational biology,
and a lot of experience in applied machine learning. Therefore I'm also a 
"data scientist". I've worked for some famous companies, like Twitch and Yelp, and 
founded two YCombinator-funded startups.

If you have an interesting career opportunity, please contact me: tim@500errors.com

# Professional Experience

<div class='job-header'>
<h2 class='company'>Omniref.com</h2>
<h2 class='date'>2015-2017</h2>
<h3 class='title'>Founder/CEO</h3>
</div>

I co-created Omniref, a web application for annotating source code. Grew
the site from nothing to hundreds of thousands of monthly unique visitors
and tens of millions of pages. We graduated from the 
[YCombinator winter 2015](https://blog.ycombinator.com/yc-backed-omniref-yc-w15-is-rap-genius-for-code/){:target="_blank"}
batch, and raised significant seed funding from well-known investors.

In addition to all of the administrative and legal tasks, I wrote half of the
code for the site (Ruby, Rails), wrote a number of popular blog posts (i.e.
"marketing") and did all other user outreach. 

<div class='job-header'>
<h2 class='company'>Vayable.com</h2>
<h2 class='date'>2012-2014</h2>
<h3 class='title'>Founder/CTO</h3>
</div>

Vayable was a marketplace for unique tours and travel experiences. Graduated from the
[YCombinator summer 2012](https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/21/y-combinator-s12-batch-4/){:target="_blank"} batch, 
and raised outside funding from top angel and venture investors. We were covered extensively
by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/travel/click-here-for-an-offbeat-experience.html){:target="_blank"}, 
[Fortune](http://fortune.com/2012/10/03/11-sites-that-want-to-rule-the-share-economy/){:target="_blank"}, and many others. 

In addition to writing all of the code for the original site (Ruby, Rails), 
I interviewed, hired, managed a team of engineers, coordinated product development,
and did basically anything else that needed to be done. 

<div class='job-header'>
<h2 class='company'>Yelp.com</h2>
<h2 class='date'>2010-2012</h2>
<h3 class='title'>Senior Engineer</h3>
</div>

I was early member of Yelp's search and data-mining team, and a "data 
scientist" before the term existed. I wrote Yelp's A/B testing framework (Python),
and developed infrastructure for the real-time gathering and analysis of 
site metrics (Hadoop, HDFS, MySQL, enormous gobs of Python). 

Years before the advent of frameworks like Apache Spark, my system was processing 
hundreds of gigabytes of data daily, and touched every pageview on Yelp.com (at that 
time, over a hundred million monthly unique visitors). I don't know if this counts 
as "big data" today, but it definitely wasn't small data at the time.

<div class='job-header'>
<h2 class='company'>Twitch.tv (was Justin.tv)</h2>
<h2 class='date'>2008-2010</h2>
<h3 class='title'>Senior Engineer</h3>
</div>

I was one of the first engineers for the site that became Twitch.tv responsible
for the design, development and maintenance of major features that still exist 
today. Some of my accomplishments:

 - Developed a pro account feature and oversaw its development into a 
source of millions of dollars in annual revenue.

 - Built and maintained a software infrastructure for payments
that handled tens of thousands of transactions every month (before 
Stripe, Braintree, etc. existed)

 - Created a real-time storage infrastructure used to archive over 
hundreds of TB of video in our datacenter, ultimately saving millions 
in bandwith and storage costs.

# Education

## PhD, Computational Biology (Biochemistry)
University of Washington

Dissertation:  *"Development of statistical potential functions for the
                prediction of protein-nucleic acid interactions from
                structure."*

My dissertation research was in computational structural biology, on the
application of machine learning algorithms to the problem of predicting
protein-DNA interactions from structure. (You've watched NOVA and seen
scientists spinning molecules around on computer screens? Yeah, that's
actually what I did. Plus some math.)

## BS, Computer Science and Biology
University of Denver

I was a double major in CS and Biology. I studied a lot.

# Technology buzzword bingo

Like most experienced programmers, I can (and do) pick up new things
quickly. I've worked with a huge number of platforms, libraries and tools,
but if it helps, here's a non-exhaustive list of common *technologies* that 
I have used professionally:

Ruby, Rails, Python, ECMAScript/Javascript, Java, C++, C, R, 
Memcached, HAProxy, Boost, Twisted, ElasticSearch, Lucene, Hadoop, 
HDFS, Postgres, MySQL, Nginx, Apache, Linux, Git, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Slim, HAML, 
Heroku, AWS, S3, EC2, RDS, CloudFront, Route53

Here's some of the "data science" skills I have used professionally:

Supervised/unsupervised learning, Bayesian classifiers, Linear regression,
Logistic regression, SVM, Random forests, Clustering (kNN, k-means, hierarchical, etc.),
ANOVA, Principal Component Analysis, Descriptive statistics, Probability
theory
